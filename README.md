[glue_tubes](glue_tubes) is a folder with the original dataset (only images). This dataset should be labeled in Roboflow.

[Glue Tubes Keypoints Project.v1-version-1.yolov5pytorch](Glue%20Tubes%20Keypoints%20Project.v1-version-1.yolov5pytorch) is a folder with Roboflow-labeled dataset (imaged and txt-files with coordinates of rectangles). Rectangle labels in txt-files are ready to be transformed into keypoints and bounding boxes.
